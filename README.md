#### Build Process

Requires node and npm. After installing node, from the project root run `npm install -g grunt-cli` to install Grunt locally. Next run `npm install` which will install all local dependencies for the gruntfile. After that you can simply run `grunt` to build. The distribution files will be placed in `build\targets\web`.
